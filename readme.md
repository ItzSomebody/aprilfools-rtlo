# April Fool's RTLO

One of our members on [redpwn](https://github.com/redpwn?type=source) sometimes messes around with us by mixing the right-to-left (0x202e) and left-to-right (0x202d) override unicode characters into messages and asking people to post the rigged messages into Discord (which filters out RTLO) to get the original message back.

So, I took some inspiration and made this for my own convenience.

How to use:
1. Visit https://itzsomebody.github.io/aprilfools-rtlo/
2. Type in whatever you want (keep it PG kids)
3. Hit the "Magic it up" button
4. Paste the modified message into a PasteBin or GitHub Gist (or anything that allows you to send people raw text)
5. Ask people to paste the strange-looking message into a Discord chat.
6. Watch them get confused.
